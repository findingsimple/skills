# Retro Summary

Extract retrospective data from a FigJam board, categorize stickies, synthesize themes with AI, and write a structured summary to the Obsidian vault.

Supported retro formats:
- **Rose/Thorn/Bud** — 3-column layout (Rose = strengths, Thorn = challenges, Bud = opportunities)
- **Wind/Sun/Anchor/Reef** — 2×2 grid layout (Wind = helped us forward, Sun = made us feel good, Anchor = held us back, Reef = future risks)

## Instructions

Follow these steps exactly:

### Step 0 — Parse arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the FigJam URL and optional flags:

1. **FigJam URL** (required) — a `figma.com/board/...` URL. Extract `fileKey` from the URL path and `nodeId` from the `node-id` query parameter (converting `-` to `:`). If no `node-id` parameter is present, default to `0:1` (the page root).
2. **`--team <name>`** (optional) — explicitly set the team name for the output path. If not provided, the team is inferred from the board name (see Step 2).
3. **`--dry-run`** (optional) — preview output without writing any files to the vault.
4. **`--list`** (optional) — list all retro sections on the board with their dates and node IDs, then stop.

If no URL is provided, show usage help and stop:
```
Usage: /retro-summary <figjam-url> [--team <name>] [--dry-run] [--list]

Examples:
  /retro-summary https://figma.com/board/abc123/TeamA-Retro?node-id=45-678
  /retro-summary https://figma.com/board/abc123/Retro --team TeamA
  /retro-summary https://figma.com/board/abc123/Retro --list
  /retro-summary https://figma.com/board/abc123/Retro --dry-run
```

### Step 1 — Load environment

Check that the required environment variables are set:
```bash
echo "VAULT: $OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH"
echo "TEAMS: $OBSIDIAN_TEAMS_PATH"
```

Both `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` and `OBSIDIAN_TEAMS_PATH` must be set. If either is missing, stop and tell the user to add them to `~/.zshrc`.

Verify the teams path exists with `ls`. If it doesn't exist, stop and tell the user.

### Step 2 — Fetch board data & resolve team

Call `mcp__figma__get_figjam` with the extracted `fileKey` and `nodeId`.

If the nodeId is a page (`0:1`) or a top-level frame, the response will contain multiple `<section>` elements — one per retro session. Each section has a `name` attribute containing the retro date (e.g., "5 Nov 2025").

If the nodeId points to a specific section, the response will contain just that section's stickies.

**Resolve team name** (used for the output path):

1. If `--team` was provided, use that value directly.
2. Otherwise, infer from the FigJam board/file name in the URL path segment (e.g., `TeamA-Retro` → `TeamA`, `TeamB-Retrospective` → `TeamB`). The team name is the portion before the first hyphen or the word "Retro"/"Retrospective" (case-insensitive).
3. If the team cannot be inferred, scan `{OBSIDIAN_TEAMS_PATH}` for existing team directories and use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick which team this retro belongs to.

Verify the resolved team directory exists at `{OBSIDIAN_TEAMS_PATH}/{team_name}/`. If it doesn't exist, stop and tell the user.

### Step 3 — Section selection

**If `--list` flag is set:**
- Parse all `<section>` elements from the response
- Display each section's name (date) and node ID in a table:
  ```
  Retro sections found:
  | # | Date          | Node ID |
  |---|---------------|---------|
  | 1 | 5 Nov 2025    | 45:678  |
  | 2 | 19 Nov 2025   | 45:679  |
  | ...                         |
  ```
- Stop execution.

**If the URL points to a specific section node (not `0:1`):**
- Use that section directly.

**If the URL points to the full board (node `0:1` or no node-id):**
- List all available retro sections with their dates.
- Check the vault for existing retro files (`Retro - {YYYY-MM-DD}.md`) and mark already-processed sections with a checkmark in the listing.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick which retro to summarize. Present the section dates as options (up to 4 most recent; include "Other" for older ones).
- Record the selected section's `nodeId` — the sub-agent in Step 4 will fetch and parse the section data.

### Step 4 — Extract and categorize stickies (sub-agent)

Spawn a **general-purpose agent** with:
- The `fileKey` and selected section's `nodeId`
- The full text of **Steps 4a–4d** below as working instructions
- Instruction to first call `mcp__figma__get_figjam` with the `fileKey` and `nodeId` to fetch the section data
- Instruction to save parsed data to `/tmp/retro_parsed.json` (via Bash, not the Write tool) as JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "template": "rose-thorn-bud",
    "section_name": "5 Nov 2025",
    "categories": {
      "Rose": [{"author": "Alex Chen", "text": "Great teamwork", "votes": 2}]
    },
    "participants": ["Alex Chen", "Jordan Park"]
  }
  ```
- Instruction to return a formatted summary: each category with sticky count and list (`- **{Author}**: {text} (N votes)`), plus a participants line

The main agent resumes from **Step 5** once the sub-agent completes.

#### 4a — Detect retro template

Scan the section data for `<text>` elements to identify which template the board uses:

- If headers containing **"Rose"**, **"Thorn"**, and **"Bud"** are found → **rose-thorn-bud** template
- If headers containing **"Wind"**, **"Sun"**, **"Anchor"**, and **"Reef"** are found → **wind-sun-anchor-reef** template

Record the detected template — it controls how stickies are categorized (Step 4c) and the output format (Steps 5–7).

#### 4b — Extract stickies

For each `<sticky>` element, extract:
- `id` — the sticky's node ID
- `x` — the sticky's x-coordinate position
- `y` — the sticky's y-coordinate position
- `color` — the color attribute (e.g., `STICKY_RED`, `STICKY_GREEN`, `STICKY_YELLOW`, `CUSTOM`)
- `author` — the author attribute (contributor name)
- `text` — the text content of the sticky

**Filter** — Remove stickies that:
- Have empty or whitespace-only text content
- Have node ID prefixes significantly lower than the section's own node ID prefix (stale stickies from a previous retro). For example, if the section node is `281:2986`, stickies with prefixes like `191:xxx` or `205:xxx` are likely leftovers — exclude them.

#### 4c — Categorize stickies

**For rose-thorn-bud template** (3-column layout):

Record each header's x-coordinate. Use sticky color as the **primary** indicator, with nearest-header proximity as a fallback:
- `STICKY_RED` → **Rose**
- `STICKY_GREEN` → **Bud**
- `CUSTOM` (blue) or any other color → assign to the **nearest column header** by x-distance

  **Why nearest-header instead of midpoints:** Rose stickies consistently extend well past the Rose/Thorn midpoint because the Rose column is wide. Using nearest-header naturally handles this.

**For wind-sun-anchor-reef template** (2×2 grid layout):

Record each header's x **and** y coordinates. Assign each sticky to the nearest header using **2D Euclidean distance**: `sqrt((sx - hx)² + (sy - hy)²)`. The header with the smallest distance wins.

Category meanings:
- **Wind** — "Helped us forward" (process wins, helpful practices, decisions that accelerated the team)
- **Sun** — "Made us feel good" (culture, morale, celebrations, positive team moments)
- **Anchor** — "Held us back" (blockers, pain points, friction, things that slowed the team)
- **Reef** — "Future risks ahead" (risks on the horizon, things to watch out for, potential future blockers)

#### 4d — Count votes

Look for `<stamp>` and `<instance>` elements near each sticky (within ~200px proximity). **Deduplicate by type**: if the same stamp/instance type appears multiple times near a sticky (e.g., 3 "Thumbs up"), count it as **1 vote**. Each unique reaction type counts as 1 vote. Record the total unique vote count per sticky.

### Step 5 — Present extracted data

Display the summary returned by the Step 4 sub-agent to the user.

Ask the user: "Does the categorization look correct? If counts need adjusting, tell me. Otherwise I'll proceed with synthesis and write to vault."

If the user provides corrections, update `/tmp/retro_parsed.json` accordingly (via Bash, not the Write tool) and re-display the corrected summary before proceeding.

### Step 6 — AI synthesis and output assembly (sub-agent)

Spawn a **general-purpose agent** with:
- The path `/tmp/retro_parsed.json`
- The FigJam source URL, team name, and section date
- Instruction to:
  1. Read `/tmp/retro_parsed.json` via Bash `cat` (not the Read tool)
  2. Read `~/.claude/skills/retro-summary/PROMPTS.md` for the synthesis prompt matching the template type
  3. Construct the synthesis prompt with the categorized stickies and perform the synthesis
  4. Read `~/.claude/skills/retro-summary/TEMPLATES.md` for the output template and formatting rules
  5. Assemble the complete output file (frontmatter + synthesis sections + raw feedback sections)
  6. Return the complete markdown content ready to write

The main agent resumes from **Step 7** with the returned content.

### Step 7 — Write to vault

**Output path:** `{OBSIDIAN_TEAMS_PATH}/{team_name}/Retros/Retro - {YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

Parse the section date from the section name (e.g., "5 Nov 2025") into `YYYY-MM-DD` format for the file name.

Create the `Retros/` directory if it doesn't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p "{OBSIDIAN_TEAMS_PATH}/{team_name}/Retros"
```

**Normal mode:** Use the Write tool to create the file with the content returned from Step 6. Confirm to the user:
```
Retro summary written to: {file_path}
```

**Dry-run mode:** Print the full file content to output instead of writing. Prefix with:
```
**DRY RUN** — would write to: {file_path}
```
